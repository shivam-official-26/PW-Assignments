The ternary operator, also called the conditional operator or inline if, is a shorthand way to write an if-else statement in many programming languages. Here's how it works:

Syntax:

condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false


program---

function checkNum(num){
    num%2==0? return true : return false;
}

console.log(checkNum(1))
